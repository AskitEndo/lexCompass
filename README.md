# ⚖️ LexCompass — From Legal Documents to Legal Decisions™

## 🎯 Challenge Selected

**Generative AI for Demystifying Legal Documents**
_(Also fits under LegalTech / FinTech challenges)_

Legal documents are intimidating, complex, and often inaccessible to ordinary people. Most AI tools summarize — but they don't empower. We're solving legal literacy + decision-making + negotiation with an intent-aligned, anxiety-aware AI platform.
